/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for JK Festival Orders and Tickets
 * @core_philosophy: This ruleset enforces a data model where orders and tickets are stored in separate collections.
 *  All read and write operations are governed by the principle of authorization independence.
 *  That is, read and write rules on 'tickets' do not require fetching data from the 'orders' collection.
 * @data_structure:
 *  - /orders/{orderId}: Stores order information.
 *  - /tickets/{ticketId}: Stores ticket information, including the orderId to which it belongs.
 * @key_security_decisions:
 *  - Users cannot list all orders or tickets (listing is only possible through application logic)
 *  - Data validation is minimal to allow for rapid prototyping and schema iteration.
 * @denormalization_for_authorization:
 *  - The tickets collection denormalizes customerName and customerEmail to avoid the need for fetching the parent order document during authorization.
