    "reasoning": "The Firestore database structure is designed to manage orders and tickets for the JK Festival. It uses two collections: `orders` and `tickets`. The `tickets` collection includes the `orderId` to establish a relationship with the `orders` collection. To maintain Authorization Independence, particularly for listing tickets related to a specific order, the `customerName` and `customerEmail` are duplicated in the `tickets` collection, avoiding the need for security rules to fetch the parent order document. The `id` field is used as the document id.\n\nThis structure supports the required QAPs:\n\n1.  **Secure `list` operations for tickets by order:** By including `orderId` and the relevant customer information on each ticket, security rules can efficiently validate access to tickets belonging to a specific order without requiring `get()` operations on the parent `order` document. This avoids hierarchical authorization and ensures atomic operations.\n2.  **Data integrity:** Timestamps (`createdAt`) are included in both `orders` and `tickets` to track creation times. The explicit `status` field in the `tickets` collection (`valid` or `used`) maintains clear state management for tickets.\n3. **Clarity of Intent**: The document structures are named semantically."
